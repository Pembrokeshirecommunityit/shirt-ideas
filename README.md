# Shirt Ideas

This is a repo where I track new shirt concepts for [Dev Tees](http://devtees.com).

Have a shirt idea you'd like to see us produce? Open an issue and suggest it! If we print your idea we'll send you a free tee.

## FAQ

### Are your designs open source?

Nope! All of the Dev Tees designs, as well as concept art posted in this repository (including issue threads) are copyright of Dev Tees (except for design submissions posted by other users, which are copyright of the respective artwork creators) and not licensed for reproduction elsewhere.

### What type of concepts make it into production?

Dev Tees is all about creating unique artwork concepts that are clever, fun, original, and specifically developer related. All artwork concepts are executed by [@jglovier](https://github.com/jglovier) for creative and intellectual property reasons. 

If you have an awesome design of your own that you'd like to get printed, or if you would like to see some cool existing logo printed (like the [Open Source logo](https://github.com/devtees/shirt-ideas/issues/25) or [the Pipegreppers Union](https://github.com/devtees/shirt-ideas/issues/9)), [Cotton Bureau](https://cottonbureau.com/) is a better platform for that sort of thing.

### Do you produce every design submitted here?

No. Some concepts are just not a good fit for Dev Tees. There are several reasons, like the concept is just not compelling enough, or it's too similar to something we've done before or something else out there, or it's just too hard to make the idea into a workable shirt graphic.
